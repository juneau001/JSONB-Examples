# JSONB-Examples

h1. JsonbTest

This is an example of a maven web application making use of JSON-B (JSR 367).  The libraries utilized in this particular example are those of the “Apache Johnzon”:http://johnzon.apache.org project.

h2. JsonbTest2

This is an example of a maven Java SE application making use of JSON-B (JSR 367).  Again, the libraries in this particular example are those of the “Apache Johnzon”:http://johnzon.apache.org project.

This particular example fails while attempting to utilize an adapter.  I will commit an update once resolved.  This error may be due to a bug in the API.
